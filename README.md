Combine version of [RxSwift/ActivityIndicator](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/main/RxExample/RxExample/Services/ActivityIndicator.swift) that help us to track the loading state of all publisher, particularly in network request publishers.
## Usage
### Tracking loading states of publishers
Let's declare an instance of **ActivityIndicator** wherever you want to handle the requests (ex: ViewModel):
```swift
let activityIndicator = ActivityIndicator()

/// Recommend to expose the loading state only
var loadingPublisher: AnyPublisher<Bool, Never> {
    activityIndicator.loading.eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```
Then use the `trackActivity` operator to track the state of request publishers:
```swift
refreshTokenPublisher.trackActivity(activityIndicator)
getUserInfoPublisher.trackActivity(activityIndicator)
```
Now you can handle the loading state on the View component:
```swift
viewModel.loadingPublisher
         .sink { isLoading in
            self.showHUD(isLoading)
         }
```

### Collecting error of publishers in one place
Let's declare an instance of **ErrorIndicator** wherever you want to handle the error of publisher requests (ex: ViewModel):
```swift
let errorIndicator = ErrorIndicator()

/// Recommend to expose the errors only
var errorPublisher: AnyPublisher<Error, Never> {
    errorIndicator.errors.eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```
Then use the `trackError` operator to track the state of request publishers:
```swift
refreshTokenPublisher.trackError(errorIndicator)
// Can track loading together
getUserInfoPublisher.trackActivity(activityIndicator)
                    .trackError(errorIndicator)
```
Now you can handle the errors in one place such as in the View component:
```swift
viewModel.errorPublisher
         .sink { error in
            self.showErrorPopup(error)
         }
```
